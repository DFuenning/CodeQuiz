The attached files make up a quiz developed with javascript, some jquery, css/bootstrap, and HTML.

The quiz is designed so that once the user clicks the start button for the quiz, a timer will begin and last for 60 seconds in total. However, for every incorrect answer that is given, the timer is decremented by 10 seconds, shortening your time to finish the quiz. 

There are 7 questions in total consisting very basic coding development questions. The purpose of this quiz was not meant to be challenging, but to learn what is possible with javascript. 

Once the quiz is finished, by either answering all of the ask questions or the end of allotted time, you will be shown both your final score (the number of questions answered correctly) and be asked to enter your initials or any name you choose to be added to the scoreboard. Once you click submit, you will jump to the scoreboard to view other results that have been saved on local storage and printed on this separate page. 

You then have the ability to clear the scoreboard or to jump back into the quiz to retake it.
